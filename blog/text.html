      <h1>Fun criterion</h1>
<ul>
<li>The fun criterion by David Deutsch</li>
<li>Part of his explanation on his book X</li>
<li>Also expanded by his conversation with Lulie and interview with X</li>
<li>Basically, you have fun when your theories are aligned on where to go - otherwise, you will feel the discomfort of some kind because your theories are confronting each other and you have a clash that needs to be solved</li>
<li>A criterion is a principle or standard by which something may be judged or decided.
<ul>
<li>What exactly? It only tells that exists a conflict of theories, not what should be done</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using that whenever we have a conflict we should:
<ul>
<li>Identify the conflicting theories the best we can</li>
<li>Decide which to prioritize</li>
<li>And destroy/align those theories that do not agree with your prioritized ones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This can be hard because these theories can have unconscious parts</li>
<li>This reminds me of the de Melo ideas… just drop your theories of control, face reality as it is, and not through your illusions → in this sense, this is aligning your theories</li>
<li>Anyway, all this analysis can take time. But sometimes you do not have that time.</li>
<li>Grit and push-through can help by taking you to another state where your theories and preferences change (basically you force your way until one theory gets reinforced and the other one is dropped) → but they should be used sparingly</li>
<li>To go far and have a good journey, you need coherence between your explicit, inexplicit, and subconscious theories.</li>
<li>On the last note, I think therapy can help (if it serves to lead you to more coherence) since it creates a social commitment to stop and improve your theory's coherence.</li>
<li>But one can use the time for reflection to do the same. i.e. self-repair / theory tidying can be done alone if one is aware of its own thoughts. And Reality is the ultimate (bad) theory killer.</li>
</ul>
